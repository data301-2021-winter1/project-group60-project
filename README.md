## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As individuals who are very keen on ‘expenses,’ we would like to reduce as much of our expenses by predicting insurance costs. We find this dataset interesting and useful because especially as international students, exploring such data will be more useful for us to predict the costs to reduce as much expense as possible. Not only would we derive useful information for ourselves but also improve our skills of working with datasets by exploring quantitative and categorical data.

We found three positive correlation lines between the age of participants and the charges they each pay: the older the person is, the higher charges he/she pays. Although it may be “obvious” to pay more medical expenses as you get older, we would like to find out other compelling relationships that may affect the medical charge. Medical expense dataset includes interesting factors such as smoking status that we could explore to find relationships between each factor to display on the dashboard. We think it will be intriguing to find out the causes of high charges to prevent high medical expenses in the future. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Packt, a publishing company, provided this data along with a book “Machine Learning with R” by Brett Lantz. Our data is about personal medical expenses. Knowing about medical expenses data would be interesting as it would familiarize us to various types of people who have various requirements for their health at various ages. Date set includes quantitative and categorial data: age (ordinal), sex (categorical), bmi (quantitative,) children (quantitative), smoker (categorical), region (categorical), and charges (quantitative). It contains 7 columns and 1337 rows. This data was updated four years ago on Kaggle. Our purpose of choosing the personal medical expenses dataset is to predict insurance costs by analyzing relevant correlation among variables. The data about personal medical expenses was acquired from a site named Kaggle where various types of datas are stored. This data can be used for research as it is an open public data. The way in which the data was acquired is unknown.
